If you're looking to streamline your web design process and ensure your websites are responsive and stylish, Bootstrap is a framework you should consider. In this beginner's guide, we'll introduce you to Bootstrap, explore its key features, and show you how to create modern, responsive web designs efficiently.

## What is Bootstrap?

**Subtitle: The Popular CSS Framework for Responsive Design**

Bootstrap is a widely-used CSS framework developed by Twitter that provides a collection of pre-designed components and layout options to help you build responsive and visually appealing websites quickly. It offers a set of styles and JavaScript components that can be easily integrated into your projects, making it a go-to choice for web developers looking for efficiency and consistency.

## Getting Started with Bootstrap

**Subtitle: Installation and Setup**

Before you start using Bootstrap, you'll need to set up your project. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Installation:** You can include Bootstrap in your project via CDN or by installing it via npm. To use the CDN, add the following links to your HTML `<head>`:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/5.3.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
   <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/5.3.0/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
npm install bootstrap

Configuration: Once Bootstrap is installed, you can customize it by overriding its default styles. Create a custom CSS file where you can add your custom styles and link it after the Bootstrap CSS file.
